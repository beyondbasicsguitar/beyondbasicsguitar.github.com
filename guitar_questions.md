## Why Do I have to Use Alternate Picking?

**Question**: You have asked me to practice "strict" alternate picking. Well, it seems that I have a habit of always using a down stroke when moving to a higher string (like 6 to 5) and an upstroke when moving to a lower string. Not sure where I picked this up but it is proving very difficult to change. I would rather not spend the time to un-learn this given all the new things I really want to work on.  What are your thoughts on this? Is it critical for me to break this habit now? Will it lead to a roadblock later on if I don't?
