**Question:** I want to buy my first guitar, should I buy one with nylon or steel strings?


**Answer:** Choosing a nylon or steel string guitar is an important decision. The nylon string guitar is really appropriate for classical music, but in my opinion, is not the right way to go for most other styles. It's possible to play classical music on a steel string but steel strings do not have the flexibility or tonal range needed for serious classical right hand technique. Conversely, the sound produced by the nylon-stringed classical guitar is not what we associate with traditional popular styles such as folk, blues, jazz, rock, pop etc. Also, string bending techniques and fingerings common to pop music styles aren't accessible on the wider classical fingerboard. So, you should buy a steel string folk guitar if you are mostly interested in popular styles and might want to dabble a bit in the classical realm, or buy a nylon string classical guitar if the reverse is true. I would not worry about whether steel or nylon strings are "easier" to play. I believe that idea to be a false concern.
