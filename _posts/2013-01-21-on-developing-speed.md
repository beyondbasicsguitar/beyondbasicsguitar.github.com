**Finger Dexterity vs. Brain Dexterity**

Students often want to know how to develop faster picking technique. Well, the obvious path is to practice lots of finger and scale exercises while maintaining relaxed body tension.  However, less obvious but more important is to develop **brain dexterity**.  If you can play a fast riff but mentally can’t switch gears as the next chord comes rushing up, you’re going to have a problem!  I may not be the fastest player in the world, but my mind is VERY nimble. I have practiced in all 12 keys, I can spell chords easily. I know my chord structures, chord scales, arpeggios, intervals, key signatures, etc, very well and my ears are trained. Like a well-written computer program, my mind can negotiate fast changing chord progressions and react quickly to fellow improvisers in the band. This is a kind of speed that is so valuable and often misunderstood. So by all means, develop left and right hand technique, but make sure you have “programmed” your own computer and minimized “bugs” by practicing musical ideas through all twelve keys.
To help students with the programming task, I have them write out important theory concepts and common chord progressions in all 12 keys. You can download some worksheets I have created for this purpose:
