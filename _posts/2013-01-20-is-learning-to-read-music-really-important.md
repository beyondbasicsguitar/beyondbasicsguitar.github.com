**Question:** Why do I have to bother with learning to sightread traditional music notation? I have been using TAB for years and am comfortable with that…

**Answer:** Learning to read music is beneficial in several ways that may not be readily apparent to the non-reader. In my teaching practice, one of my goals is to help you become a musician, not just a guitar player. I want you to be able to speak the language of music with pianists, horn players, bass players, drummers, etc. For instance, if you have a band and you want the keyboard player to work with the same piece of music, he will look at you cross-eyed if you hand him a piece of tablature to learn. There is nothing inherently wrong with TAB as a device for communicating how to finger a piece of guitar music, but that’s all it can do.

Learning to read music notation is one of the basic skills of musicianship and it reinforces many other skills you use as you play, as well as providing additional perks:

* Memorization of the fingerboard
: Learning the fingerboard helps to quicken all music-making processes that require you to play the "right" notes!

* Musical fluency
: When you become a proficient reader, you no longer read just one note, then the next note, etc. You notice groups of notes and automatically relate them to each other. For instance, you think to yourself: "Ah, these notes constitute a Cmaj7 chord." Or, "this measure contains A dorian scale." This ability to analyse and categorize as you read improves the quickness with which you can finger the notes. If you already know how to play the chord or scale, your fingers will jump to that place on the neck. Here's a non-musical analogy: When you see a car driving down the road, you don't think to yourself C - A - R, or wheels, rims, fenders, bumper, hood, motor, etc. You just perceive CAR, categorize it automatically and then interact with it, i.e. get out of its way or open the door, etc. without mulling it over!

* Improves soloing
: I believe good sightreading skills improves one's soloing skills. It works like this: When sightreading, the first thing you do is analyse the note or structure, then you find it on the fingerboard and play. When you improvise, the first thing you do is listen to the melody in your head and then intuitively locate it on the fingerboard and play. The process is not much different - just that the inspiration for the notes comes from your inner ear rather than a piece of sheetmusic. You still have to correctly analyse what it is you are reading or hearing in order to play it accurately. Thus, the better your sightreading skills are, the faster you can translate your solo ideas to the guitar.

* Improves the ability to jam and interact with others
: This time, the inspiration for what you play comes from the other players. As you listen to your bandmates play, you absorb the sound, analyse it and then interact with your own musical response. Again, many of the same skills used in interpreting written music are used here. Of course, basic eartraining is another inter-related skill you are employing in this live situation.

* Provides an entry into the sheet music repertoire of all instruments
: When you walk into a music store, there is suddenly a huge library of music available to you, and not just music written for guitar! Music written for flute, brass, clarinet, strings or keyboard music. Any instrument that uses the treble clef is fair game. We guitarists have a smaller catalog available to us because composers did not start taking classical guitar seriously until the earlier part of the 20th century, when master guitarist [Andres Segovia](http://www.classicalguitar.net/artists/segovia) encouraged composers to write compositions for guitar which he then championed around the world. Other instruments have centuries of repertoire available. Now you can take better advantage of it!
