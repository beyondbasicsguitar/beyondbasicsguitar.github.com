Some guitarists question whether learning to sight-read traditional music notation is important. It’s an interesting question. Guitar is probably one of the few instruments on which you can become really proficient without learning to read music, and many self-taught guitarists have gotten used to using tablature. However, becoming a decent sight-reader is beneficial in several ways that may not be readily apparent to the non-reader. For instance, in my teaching practice, one of my goals is to help you become a musician, not just a guitar player. I want you to be able to speak the language of music with pianists, horn players, bass players, drummers, etc. If you want the keyboard player in your band to work with the same piece of music, he will look at you cross-eyed if you hand him a piece of tablature to learn. There is nothing inherently wrong with TAB as a device for communicating how to finger a piece of guitar music, but that’s all it can do.

Learning to sight-read reinforces many other skills you use as a fluent musician, and also provides these additional perks:
•  Memorization of the fingerboard
Learning the fingerboard helps to quicken all music-making processes that require you to play the “right” notes.
•	Musical fluency
When you become a proficient reader, you no longer read just one note, then the next note, etc. You notice groups of notes and automatically relate them to each other. For instance, you think to yourself: “Ahh, these notes constitute a Cmaj7 chord.” Or, “this measure contains a Dorian scale.” This ability to analyze and categorize as you read improves the quickness with which you can finger the notes. If you already know how to play the chord or scale you just analyzed, your fingers will jump to that place on the neck. Here’s a non-musical analogy: When you see a car driving down the road, you don’t think to yourself “C - A – R”, or “wheels, rims, fenders, bumper, hood, motor”, etc. You just perceive CAR, categorize it automatically and then interact with it, i.e. get out of its way or open the door without mulling it over!
•	Improves soloing
I believe good sight-reading skills improves one’s soloing skills. It works like this: When sight-reading, the first thing you do is analyze the note or chord structure, then you find it on the fingerboard and play. When improvising, the first thing you do is listen to the melody in your head and then intuitively locate it on the fingerboard and play. It’s the same process - except the inspiration for the notes comes from your inner ear rather than a piece of sheet music. You still have to correctly analyze what it is you are reading or hearing in order to play it accurately. Thus, the better your sight-reading skills are, the faster you can translate your solo ideas to the guitar.
•	Improves the ability to jam and interact with others
This time, the inspiration for what you play comes from the other players. As you listen to your bandmates play, you absorb the sound, analyze it and then interact with your own musical response. Again, many of the same skills used in interpreting written music are used here. Of course, ear training is another skill you are employing in this live situation.
•	Provides an entry into the sheet music repertoire of all instruments
When you walk into a music store, there is suddenly a huge library of music available, and not just music written for guitar! Great music has been written for all instruments. Any instrument that uses the treble clef is the easiest to consider (e.g. brass, woodwinds, strings, keyboards). We guitarists have a smaller catalog available to us because composers did not start taking classical guitar seriously until the earlier part of the 20th century, at which time, master guitarist [Andres Segovia](http://www.classicalguitar.net/artists/segovia/) encouraged composers to write compositions for guitar which he then championed around the world. Other instruments have centuries of repertoire available. As a proficient reader, you can take better advantage of it!
