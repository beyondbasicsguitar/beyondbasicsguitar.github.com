"Thanks again for your great music at our party. Your playing was beautiful and the music added a very nice atmosphere to the "quieter" end of the day. Many people spoke of how impressed they were with your playing. We will have good memories for a long time!"

--Laurie and Brian Semprebon, July 2007

"Everyone at the wedding enjoyed your music. Tastefully selected and tastefully performed. Thanks for learning our special song, Theme from a Man and a Woman, and for working on song selection and appropriateness. I would highly recommend you."

--Rob Seidel, May, 2007
