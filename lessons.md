**Where:** All lessons are taught at my home studio in East Hartford, CT.

**Cost:**	 $45.00.

**When:**  Weekday evenings, 6-9pm.

**Length:**  60 minutes. I don't offer 1/2 hour lessons. I believe the 30 minute lesson is designed primarily to help the teacher to make as much money as possible, not to help students learn. I purposely keep my hourly rate very reasonable so that most people can afford a full hour. In an hour lesson, I can take the time to really work with you, mentor you, answer your questions more fully, demonstrate techniques, play with you and show by example how it's done. So much more fun for both me and you!

**Frequency:**  I prefer weekly lessons whenever possible. It allows me to monitor your progress more efficiently, correcting technique problems or misunderstandings before they become ingrained. Occasionally, some students prefer to come biweekly or even monthly due to limited practice time or financial constraints. I don't have a problem with this but highly recommend we try to start our work together with several consecutive, weekly lessons to establish some background, direction and rapport.
