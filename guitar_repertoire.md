..Duke Ellington, Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Jerome Kern, J.S. Bach, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Rogers & Hart, the Beatles...My repertoire draws material from the classic American composers of jazz, spanning the swing, bebop, blues and cool genres and also includes lots of Brazilian, Latin and Tin Pan Alley standards.
