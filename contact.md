Thank you for playing so beautifully at our dinner party Thursday night. Not only did all of our guests comment on your delightful music, our neighbors told me they sat on their porch to hear you play.  I think our evening was a real success for the Ellison Center. Maybe a "big benefactor" had the privilege of hearing you play. Thanks again!
--Janet Hinkley, Hingham, MA
