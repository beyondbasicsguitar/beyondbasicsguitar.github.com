"Thank you for playing so beautifully at our dinner party Thursday night. Not only did all of our guests comment on your delightful music, our neighbors told me they sat on their porch to hear you play.  I think our evening was a real success for the Ellison Center. Maybe a "big benefactor" had the privilege of hearing you play. Thanks again!"

"The first two phone calls I received at work this morning concerned you. Both callers raved about how much you added to the cultivation party last night. Once said "The music was perfect. It was absolutely beautiful and varied, but not obtrusive, For a summer party, it couldn't have been better." The other said, "You have no idea what a difference it made having that wonderful music. It was the best possible way to show what we're all about." On behalf of all of us who are working to make The Ellison Center For The Arts a reality, many, many thanks for a job well done!"

"I cannot thank you enough for all that you did for my Dad's memorial service. We are so grateful to you for setting up the sound system, recording music and most of all, for so beautifully playing the guitar. I will never forget it. Music is so important in our lives and reaches deep down and touches us in so many ways. I felt so many emotions as you played. Your music connected the pieces of the service together and made it so very beautiful. Thank you so much."
--C. Champy, Windsor, CT
